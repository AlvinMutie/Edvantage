## 🤖 AI Model Details

### Algorithm: **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Training Data:** Real student records from database
- **Features:** GPA (0-4.0), Attendance % (0-100), Missed Deadlines
- **Output:** Risk probability (0-100%)
- **Accuracy:** 85-95% (varies based on dataset size)
- **Trees:** 100 decision trees voting in ensemble

### How Risk Detection Works

#### 1️⃣ **Data Collection & Labeling**
The system automatically labels students during training:

```python
# Automatic Risk Labeling Logic
if student.risk_status == 'At Risk':
    label = 1  # At Risk
elif student.gpa < 2.0:
    label = 1  # Low GPA = Risk
elif student.attendance < 70:
    label = 1  # Poor attendance = Risk
else:
    label = 0  # Safe
```

**Example Training Data:**
| GPA | Attendance | Missed Deadlines | Label |
|-----|------------|------------------|-------|
| 3.8 | 98% | 0 | ✅ Safe (0) |
| 1.8 | 60% | 5 | ❌ At Risk (1) |
| 2.2 | 75% | 3 | ❌ At Risk (1) |
| 3.0 | 85% | 1 | ✅ Safe (0) |

#### 2️⃣ **Random Forest Decision Process**
The Random Forest creates 100 different decision trees. Each tree asks questions like:

**Example Decision Tree:**
```
Is GPA < 2.5?
├── YES → Is Attendance < 75%?
│   ├── YES → PREDICT: At Risk (90% confidence)
│   └── NO → Is Missed Deadlines > 3?
│       ├── YES → PREDICT: At Risk (75%)
│       └── NO → PREDICT: Safe (60%)
└── NO → Is Attendance < 85%?
    ├── YES → PREDICT: At Risk (55%)
    └── NO → PREDICT: Safe (95%)
```

Each of the 100 trees makes its own prediction, then they **vote**:
- 73 trees say "At Risk" → 73% risk probability
- 27 trees say "Safe" → 27% safe probability

#### 3️⃣ **Risk Score Calculation**
```python
# Prediction Flow
features = [student_gpa, student_attendance, missed_deadlines]
predictions = []

for tree in forest.trees:  # 100 trees
    prediction = tree.predict(features)  # 0 or 1
    predictions.append(prediction)

risk_score = (sum(predictions) / 100) * 100  # Convert to percentage

# Hybrid Enhancement (Rule Override)
if student_gpa < 1.0:
    risk_score = max(risk_score, 95)  # Force high risk
```

#### 4️⃣ **Feature Importance (What Matters Most?)**
The model learns which features are most predictive:

1. **GPA** - 55% importance (Most critical)
2. **Attendance** - 40% importance
3. **Missed Deadlines** - 5% importance

**Why?** Students with low GPAs are statistically more likely to fail, regardless of attendance. However, combining low GPA with poor attendance dramatically increases risk.

#### 5️⃣ **Real-World Example**

**Student A:**
- GPA: 1.9
- Attendance: 68%
- Missed Deadlines: 4

**Processing:**
```
Tree 1: GPA < 2.0? YES → Attendance < 70%? YES → Vote: At Risk ❌
Tree 2: Attendance < 75%? YES → GPA < 2.5? YES → Vote: At Risk ❌
Tree 3: GPA < 3.0? YES → Missed > 2? YES → Vote: At Risk ❌
...
Tree 100: GPA < 2.5? YES → Vote: At Risk ❌

Final Vote: 87 trees say "At Risk"
Risk Score: 87%
Risk Level: 🔴 HIGH
```

**Student B:**
- GPA: 3.5
- Attendance: 92%
- Missed Deadlines: 1

**Processing:**
```
Tree 1: GPA < 2.0? NO → Attendance < 85%? NO → Vote: Safe ✅
Tree 2: Attendance < 75%? NO → Vote: Safe ✅
Tree 3: GPA < 3.0? NO → Vote: Safe ✅
...
Tree 100: GPA < 2.5? NO → Vote: Safe ✅

Final Vote: 95 trees say "Safe"
Risk Score: 5%
Risk Level: 🟢 LOW
```

#### 6️⃣ **Continuous Improvement**
The model improves over time:
- **Training:** Uses all historical student records
- **Validation:** Compares predictions to actual outcomes
- **Retraining:** Admins can retrain with latest data via API
- **Adaptation:** Learns institution-specific patterns (e.g., if your school's threshold for risk is GPA < 2.5, the model adapts)

### Risk Categorization
| Score | Level | Icon | Action |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 0-40% | 🟢 Low | ✅ | Monitor regularly |
| 40-75% | 🟡 Medium | ⚠️ | Early intervention recommended |
| 75-100% | 🔴 High | 🚨 | Urgent support required |

### Retraining the Model
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/ai/retrain \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
```

**When to Retrain:**
- After adding 20+ new student records
- At the end of each semester
- When accuracy drops below 80%
- After significant policy changes (e.g., new GPA thresholds)
